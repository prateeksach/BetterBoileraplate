# BetterBP

Yes, you read it right. It's BetterBoilerplate. Basically, very empty boilerplate right now.
Meant to be used for AngularJS x Facebook Parse projects. Everything will be documented
very soon.

Originally forked from [ngBoilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp).

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate
$ cd ng-boilerplate
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/ng-boilerplate/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy hacking!
